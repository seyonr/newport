                        I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Ontario Tech University. My journey into the world of coding began in my adolescence, sparked by a natural curiosity about how websites and computers functioned. This initial intrigue quickly evolved into a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills, particularly in web development, and have become fascinated with the endless possibilities it offers for both creative expression and practical solutions.

Through my academic and personal projects, I strive to combine technical knowledge with creativity, aiming to contribute to the development of accessible, impactful, and enjoyable web experiences.
